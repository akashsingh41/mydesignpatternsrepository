<b>Creational: deals with object creation and initialization</b></br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Abstract Factory - creates an instance of several families of classes</br>
Builder - separates object construction from its representation</br>
Factory - creates an instance of several derived classes</br>
Prototype - a fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned</br>
Singleton - a class of which only a single instance can exist</br>
</br>
<b>Structural: deals with class & object composition</b></br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>
Adapter - match interfaces of different classes</br>
Bridge - separates an object's interface from its implementation</br>
Composite - a tree structure of simple and composite objects</br>
Decorator - add responsibilities to objects dynamically</br>
Facade - a single class that represents an entire subsystem</br>
Flyweight - a fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing</br>
Proxy - an object representing another object</br>
</br>
<b>Behavioural: deals with the communication between classes & objects</b></br>
------------------------------------------------------------------------</br>
Chain of Responsibilities - a way of passing a request between a chain of objects</br>
Command - encapsulate a command request as an object</br>
Interpreter - a way to include language elements in a program</br>
Iterator - sequentially access the elements of a collection</br>
Mediator - defines simplified communication between classes</br>
Memento - capture and restore an object's internal states</br>
Observer - a way of notifying change to a number of classes</br>
State - alter an object's behavior when it's state changes</br>
Strategy - encapsulate an algorithm inside a class</br>
Template - defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a class</br>
Visitor - defines a new operation to a class without change</br>
